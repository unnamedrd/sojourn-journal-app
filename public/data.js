After working up an appetite go to University Ave and grab a quick bite at any one of the restuarants. These places cater to the university crowd so there's a variety  of food at a price point that works for everyone",

Tourists often flock to the beautiful Riads in the center of the city and then step outside to be overwhelmed by the chaos of the city and the dusty, dry desert. But if you're an adventurer that you'll appreciate the challenges that the city offers in learning how to bargain with the shop keepers, balancing tourist instincts while remaining respectful of the locals, immersing yourself in traditions like tea and hammam",
